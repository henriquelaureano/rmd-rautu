# Knitr {-}

```
The knitr package was designed to be a transparent engine for dynamic report
generation with R, and solve some long-standing problems in Sweave.

If you are working in a .tex file but wanna insert R code,
[Knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) is a very good alternative.

This extention is .Rnw.

In a .Rnw file, by default, everything that you write is interpreted as in a .tex file. In reality, you do everything like in a \(\LaTeX\) document. The only
difference is wanna you want insert R code.

For insert R code you have to create a `chunk` like this:

```
<<>>=

@
```

Everything typed outside a `chunk` is rendered as \(\LaTeX\) code, everything 
inside a `chunk` is rendered as R code.

The same chunk options shown in the previous section can be used here. In reality,
all this options was created to use in a .Rnw file.

[Here](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/) you can see an list with all this options
and how to use them.
