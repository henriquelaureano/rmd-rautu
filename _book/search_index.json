A Markdown file has the extention .md, and can be created and edited in any programming language editor. The same with R Markdown (.rmd extention), if you are able to run R in this editor. You can use the “pure” R, without any editor. You can use Emacs, Vim, Sublime, etc. But, for rmd files the most friendly interface is RStudio. Perl is an programming language very used in UNIX systems administratives tasks, web development, finances, www form programming and bioinformatic, also having very efficient functions for text manipulation.↩ "],
["first-steps.html", "First steps YAML", " First steps If you are using a editor that’s not RStudio, you need to create a file with the extention .rmd and open the file is this editor (or create the file in the editor and save with this extentio, the final result is the same). You can do this also in RStudio, but, RStudio provides to you another way. Important To use all the R Markdown features you need the R package rmarkdown. To install the package you only need to run: install.packages(&quot;rmarkdown&quot;) And to load: library(&quot;rmarkdown&quot;) In RStudio, in the first menu option (first option in the up left), you have the options to easily create a rmd file (and others types of files and applications2). YAML Take some time to discovery by yourself this things. Is very simple and intuitive.↩ "]
