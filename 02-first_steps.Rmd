# First steps {-}

***

If you are using a editor that's not [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), you need
to create a file with the extention .rmd and open the file is this editor (or 
create the file in the editor and save with this extentio, the final result is the
same).

You can do this also in RStudio, but, RStudio provides to you another way.

***

**Important**

> **To use all the R Markdown features you need the R package `rmarkdown`.**

To install the package you only need to run:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

And to load:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("rmarkdown")
```

***

In RStudio, in the first menu option (first option in the up left), you have the
options to easily create a rmd file (and others types of files and 
applications^[Take some time to discovery by yourself this things. Is very simple 
and intuitive.]).
